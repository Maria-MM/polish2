The optional-silence phone sil occupies 17.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 85.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 17.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 2.2 hours of data, or 1.8 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 5.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (23,30.3,76)
